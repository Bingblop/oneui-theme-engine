# Samsung One UI 9.0 Modern Theme Engine & Hex Compatibility Suite

A next-generation theming framework, diagnostic suite, and compatibility layer for **Samsung Galaxy devices running One UI 6, 7, 8, and 9.0 (Android 14, 15, and 16)**.

---

## 📱 HexNext app (native, `android/`)

The main product is now a native Kotlin + Jetpack Compose app in [`android/`](android/), built by
GitHub Actions on every push. Grab the APK from the **Android APK** workflow run's artifacts (or from a
release when a `v*` tag is pushed). It needs Android 14+ and [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/).

- **Shizuku running as root (or Sui):** HexNext registers real fabricated overlays on the framework:
  all 65 Monet shades (`system_accent1..3_*`, `system_neutral1..2_*`) plus the Android 14+ Material role
  colors, generated from your accent color and palette style. Pure-black dark mode is available.
  Every step shows the real result, and the app reads the color back to verify it applied.
- **Shizuku over wireless debugging (no root):** Android refuses fabricated overlays from the shell user
  (`OverlayManagerService`: "Non-root shell cannot fabricate overlays", and `cmd overlay fabricate`
  requires root). HexNext instead hands the seed color and style to System UI's own Monet engine through
  `theme_customization_overlay_packages`. One UI may override that with its own color palette.

Build locally with `cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug`. The old WebView app in `apps/hex-next/`
is kept only as a design reference.

## 🌟 Features

- **Fabricated Runtime Resource Overlays (RRO):** Dynamic, instantaneous color and resource styling via native Android `cmd overlay fabricate`—no slow compilation, no reboot required.
- **Hex Installer One UI 9 Fix Suite:** Fully documented reverse engineering and compatibility layer enabling legacy themers to pass all setup prerequisites.
- **Theme Park Stub Engine:** Zero-overhead compatibility stub APK resolving the `com.samsung.android.themepark` ➔ `com.samsung.android.themedesigner` namespace migration.
- **HexBridge Pro App & Web Dashboard:** Native Android WebView client (`com.hexbridge.pro`) + lightweight local web server with Shizuku integration for full remote theming and diagnostics.
- **Theme Profiles:** Ready-to-use JSON theme templates (AMOLED Pure Black, Neon Violet, Cyberpunk Gold).

- [Termux](https://termux.dev/) with `git` and `python` installed

### 2. Inspect Theming Status
```bash
./bin/oneui-themer status
```

### 3. Apply Hex Installer Compatibility Fix
```bash
./bin/oneui-themer fix-hex
```

### 4. Apply a Modern Theme Profile

## 📱 Building the HexBridge Pro Native APK

To compile and sign the native companion app directly on your Android device:
```bash
cd apps/hex-bridge/build-apk
./compile.sh
```
The compiled APK will be automatically signed and placed into `/storage/emulated/0/Download/HexBridge_Pro.apk`.

## 🛠️ Reverse Engineering Summary

Our full reverse engineering breakdown of `project.vivid.hex.bodhi` reveals:
1. **Setup Check (Theme Park):** Evaluates `Settings.System.getString("current_sec_active_themepackage").startsWith("com.samsung.themedesigner")`.
2. **Build Failures:** Legacy Hex Installer attempts to build overlay APKs with deprecated resource IDs against legacy AAPT toolchains.
3. **Modern Alternative:** Using native Fabricated Overlays avoids AAPT fragmentation and provides 100% compatibility across all One UI versions.
